module atoma::vaults {
    //! This module provides the logic for Atoma's Vaults.
    //!
    //! Vaults provide the entrypoint for users to buy compute units for
    //! specific Atoma tasks. Nodes that are subscribed to the task will
    //! be allowed to process requests from users vaults, in order to accrue
    //! fees in exchange for the compute power provided.
